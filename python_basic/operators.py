# b= 3
# print(a-b)
# print(a+b)
# print(a*b)
# print(a/b)
# print(a%b)
# c =11
# d = 2
# print(c//d)

## Comparision Operator :  == , != ,<,>,<=,>=

# print(4 == 4 )
# print(3 == 4)
# print(4!=3)
# print(4>3)
# print(4<3)
# print(4<=5)
# print(5>=2)

## Assignment operator : =, +=,-=,*=,/=
# a=2
# a+=3
# print(a)
# b = 4
# b-= 5
# print(b)

## Logical or binary boolean operator : and or not
# print(4==6 and 5!=3)
# print(10 == 10 and 20>10)
# print(5>=4 or 10!=10)
# print(40<30 or 10>30)
# print(not 4==3)

## Membership operator : in , not in 
# a= "python"
# b= "thon"

# a = "math"
# b = 'orange'
# print( b not in a)

## Identity  operator : is, is not

# a = "bangladeshi"
# b = "bangladeshi"
# print(a is b)
# print(a is not b)
